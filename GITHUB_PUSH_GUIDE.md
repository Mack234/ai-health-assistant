# 🚀 How to Push Your AI Health Assistant to GitHub

## You Have 3 Options:

---

## ✅ OPTION 1: Contact Emergent Support (Recommended)

Since the VS Code/Terminal feature isn't visible in your interface:

1. **Contact Emergent Support:**
   - Ask them to help you access the terminal
   - Or request code export to GitHub
   - They can push directly for you

2. **What to tell them:**
   - "I need to push my AI Health Assistant project to GitHub"
   - "I don't see the VS Code or terminal feature"
   - "Can you help me export the code?"

---

## ✅ OPTION 2: Download and Push Locally

1. **Ask Emergent support** if they can provide a download link for:
   - File: `/tmp/ai-health-assistant.tar.gz` 
   - Size: 266KB
   - Contains: Complete project code

2. **After downloading:**

```bash
# Extract the archive
tar -xzf ai-health-assistant.tar.gz
cd ai-health-assistant

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Health Assistant"

# Create repo on GitHub first: https://github.com/new
# Then push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-health-assistant.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ OPTION 3: Manual File-by-File Copy

If all else fails, I can provide you with:
1. Each file's content one by one
2. You manually create files locally
3. Then push to GitHub

## 🔍 Where to Find VS Code in Emergent

The VS Code icon is typically located:
- **Top navigation bar** (right side)
- **Left sidebar menu**
- Look for icons like: `</>`, `⌨️`, or "Code Editor"
- Sometimes labeled as "Terminal", "Console", or "IDE"

**Can you see any of these?**
- Code icon
- Terminal icon  
- IDE menu option
- Developer tools

## 📞 Next Steps

**Tell me which option you prefer:**

1. **Should I contact support on your behalf?** (if that's possible)
2. **Can you take a screenshot** of your Emergent interface so I can help locate the VS Code/Terminal?
3. **Would you like me to provide all files** for manual local setup?

Let me know which path you'd like to take!
